## CURRENT V5.9 INTEGRATED QC + HOTSIDE RECOVERY UPDATE — 2026-10-07

- [VERIFIED] Functional execution started from main HEAD 414cc6959d9fd5d89968da19b9473b317b0cbba7; final firmware update/comment commits were completed before the documentation-sync commits.
- [VERIFIED] Firmware: V5.9 at firmware/JEXFYZ-V5.9.ino; latest firmware blob 6fec4071056aca4fd93cbeaecfc81d7f6d19ef60.
- [VERIFIED] App: 1.0.0+3; package com.horizontalzzz.jexfyz; main blob 8a2e97946c4bc4ac2aa3ea09e3a1aca4b15fc6a0.
- [IMPLEMENTED] V5.9 integrated App/Firmware QC changes remain present.
- [IMPLEMENTED] New Hotside recovery contract: 20 s Adaptive stage per rail, 19 s red + 1 s blue, green 2x only on <= hotLimit - 2°C re-arm, continuous Manual red until re-arm, and 5V terminal lock after an unrecovered 20 s Adaptive stage.
- [VERIFIED] The earlier heartbeat-helper scope issue is corrected; current helper is top-level.
- [PROTECTED] OTA Local/Online and Wi-Fi↔BLE handoff remain frozen.
- [UNVERIFIED] V5.9 compile, BIN, flash, physical, OTA, App integration, and release gates.
- [NOT RELEASED] App Build was not run by this transfer save.

# TRANSFER PROTOCOL V2 — 2026-10-06

## 2026-10-06 — V5.8 PELTIER REARM + NTC SINGLE-SAMPLE QC FIX
- [IMPLEMENTED] Active source promoted to `firmware/JEXFYZ-V5.8.ino`.
- [FIX] Peltier safety lock releases automatically at `hotLimit - 2°C`; the next successful Peltier ON retains the green 1-second re-arm feedback.
- [FIX] Locked Peltier ON attempts emit red 1-second feedback while the effective safety lock is active.
- [FIX] NTC sampling is exactly one calibrated ADC reading every 1 second; the V5.6 16-sample trimmed-mean path is retired.
- [PRESERVED] No OTA, BLE, GPIO, Adaptive timing, selector timing, voltage guard, or Peltier soft-start changes.
- [USER-CONFIRMED] V5.7 compile + hardware update succeeded before this fix.
- [UNVERIFIED] V5.8 compile/BIN/flash/physical QC is pending.
- [AUDIT PASS] Static source audit passed: no executable `delay()`, no timing `while()` loop, single NTC ADC sample path, latch auto-release path present, and no App source/workflow change.


- [IMPLEMENTED] `CHAT_TRANSFER.md` is now the detailed cross-chat boot protocol.
- [POLICY] New chats must read it first, reconcile current `main`, and avoid repeating established context questions.
- [CURRENT] V5.8 firmware QC fix is implemented; App source/build remains unchanged.
- [VERIFIED] Pre-write main HEAD: `c7faf134742fc6fdbebc3f66469c8aa5dd9980c6`.

## 2026-10-06 — V5.7 TTP223 TOUCH ACCURACY QC FIX
- [IMPLEMENTED] Firmware V5.7 is active at firmware/JEXFYZ-V5.7.ino.
- [IMPLEMENTED] TTP223 input uses 30 ms PRESS/RELEASE qualification before gesture processing.
- [IMPLEMENTED] Valid tap duration is 60–500 ms; duration is measured from raw HIGH start to raw LOW transition so qualification does not shrink the usable tap interval.
- [IMPLEMENTED] Double-tap window is 800 ms from first valid release with second-tap grace; double resolves at the decision boundary and 3+ taps in the same sequence remain cancel/no-action.
