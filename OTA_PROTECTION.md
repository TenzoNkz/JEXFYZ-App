## CURRENT V6.3 EXECUTION STATUS — 2026-10-13

### Current Online OTA connection path — 2026-10-13

- [SOURCE FIX IMPLEMENTED] V6.3 Online OTA restores the previous `cloudClient.setInsecure()` connection path. The inline ISRG Root X1 certificate, CA validation call, `configTime()`, `TIME_SYNCING` state, and 20-second NTP gate were removed. On Wi-Fi connection, the blue indicator runs directly before the GitHub GET attempt.
- [PRESERVED] The HTTPS transport, raw GitHub BIN URL allowlist for `TenzoNkz/JEXFYZ-Firmware`, redirect blocking, download size/image checks, safe-output sequencing, and OTA recovery path remain in place. `setInsecure()` does not validate the server certificate identity.
- [TEST CONTRACT UPDATED — NOT RUN] `test/v6_3_qc_contract_test.dart` now asserts the restored connection path, removal of CA/NTP gates, blue-before-GitHub flow, and retention of the URL allowlist/redirect block.
- [USER-REPORTED RESULT — 2026-10-13] The user reports that V6.3 compiled successfully after this correction and Online OTA can connect to GitHub again. This confirms the reported compile/connect result only; a complete BIN transfer, successful `Update.end()`, reboot, and confirmation of the new firmware version were not separately established here. Because CA validation and the OTA-only NTP gate were removed together, the available evidence does not isolate which one alone caused the earlier failure.
- [NOT DONE BY ASSISTANT] No firmware compile, BIN generation/publication, flash, physical OTA run, or APK Build was performed by this assistant session.

### APP BLE reconnect and Online OTA acknowledgement follow-up — 2026-10-13

- [FIXED IN APP SOURCE] Disconnect rediscovery now avoids starting when Auto Connect is disabled or no previously paired cooler identity is known. The retry loop is cancelled when Bluetooth/permissions/location prerequisites fail, and scanning is suppressed during BLE syncing. Retry starts again when Auto Connect is enabled or the app resumes while disconnected.
- [FIXED IN APP SOURCE] A missing `CLOUDOTA` ACK due to `TIMEOUT` or `DISCONNECTED` is treated as ambiguous, not as a definite rejection. The app preserves OTA recovery state and tells the user it is waiting for reconnection or an OTA result. A definite rejection while BLE remains connected still follows the rejection path.
- [REGRESSION CONTRACTS ADDED — NOT RUN] `test/v6_3_qc_contract_test.dart` now checks both retry-loop cancellation and ambiguous OTA ACK handling. No Flutter tests or Dart analysis have run for this change because this environment has no Flutter/Dart executable.
- [PRESERVED BY USER INSTRUCTION] `android/app/build.gradle` still has `versionName "Telegram @horizontalzzz"` as the user's intentional identity. It was not modified.
- [VALIDATION BOUNDARY] Source and contract assertions were reviewed statically only; the user separately reports a successful firmware compile and restored GitHub connection. No Build App/APK build, BIN publication, flash, complete OTA install, or hardware validation was performed by this assistant session.

- [CURRENT TRUTH] Active Firmware source: `firmware/JEXFYZ-V6.3.ino`, blob `8a8c64ae2a3fc7ac722a02c05feaeb614087092a`; V6.2 was retired from the active tree. App source remains `lib/main.dart`, version `1.0.0+3`.
- [FIXED] The manual Peltier safety latch now remains blocking until `enforceSafety()` observes Hotside at or below `hotLimit - 1°C` for five continuous seconds. One low sample can no longer bypass re-arm stability.
- [PRESERVED] Adaptive thermal protection remains 30 seconds at 12 V, 9 V and 5 V, with Peltier OFF and Fan 100%. Five-second stable thermal recovery before the deadline cancels the timer; otherwise 12 V/9 V steps down and unrecovered 5 V enters terminal manual-restart lock. Thermal voltage restoration remains one step after each 60-second stable interval, bounded by the saved pre-downshift ceiling.
- [CURRENT TRUTH] `pubspec.lock` is committed (blob `1e92812bfda2c28244a0556d71d1ec94084acc66`) and `.gitignore` is present. Earlier V6.2 notes about a missing lockfile are historical.
- [TEST EVIDENCE — V6.2 CANDIDATE] GitHub Actions run 38362882150 recorded 45 passing Flutter tests. Its plain `flutter analyze` exited nonzero because 23 info-level deprecation notices were treated as fatal; the existing App release workflow uses `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos`. This evidence predates the V6.3 latch patch and does not certify V6.3.
- [UNVERIFIED] The added V6.3 latch regression has not been run. User-reported compile success and restored GitHub connectivity are recorded above, but a complete OTA transfer/apply/reboot proof is not established here. No BIN generation/publication, assistant-side flash, independent hardware validation, Android BLE pairing, or APK Build was performed.
- [NOT RELEASED] V6.3 remains source-only DEVELOPMENT + QC / PRE-RELEASE. Production firmware repository and Firebase release metadata were not changed.

## HISTORICAL V6.2 OTA EXCEPTION — 2026-10-13

- Online OTA was explicitly approved for standard CA certificate verification to the already allowlisted GitHub raw BIN repository. The allowlist and existing download/update steps remain in place.
- Local OTA is explicitly unchanged: no checksum, signature, or additional verification layer was added.
- BLE write encryption/bonding was added because Online OTA credentials travel over the BLE command channel.
- V6.2 OTA paths remain uncompiled and untested on hardware. No APK build, Firmware compile, BIN, flashing or OTA operation was performed.
- This exception authorizes only the discussed Online HTTPS and BLE write protections; it does not grant broader OTA redesign.

# JE X FYZ — OTA PROTECTION

> 🔐 **OTA PROTECTED / FROZEN**

Dokumen ini adalah **segel pengingat engineering** untuk jalur OTA JE X FYZ.
Tujuannya mencegah perubahan OTA secara tidak sengaja saat kita memperbaiki fitur lain.

## 🚫 Jangan ubah sembarangan

Bagian berikut dianggap **protected**:

- Local OTA
- Online OTA
- OTA state machine
- OTA priority / lifecycle
- Wi-Fi ↔ BLE radio handoff
- OTA recovery setelah gagal
- OTA safety output
- OTA timeout dan retry logic
- Image validation
- Firmware OTA URL/path contract
- App OTA version-selection contract

**Jangan melakukan refactor, cleanup, optimasi, atau perubahan kecil pada OTA hanya karena sedang mengerjakan fitur lain.**

## ✅ Perubahan OTA hanya jika

1. Ada bug OTA yang benar-benar terbukti.
2. Root cause sudah jelas.
3. Perubahan dibahas dan disetujui secara eksplisit.
4. Setelah perubahan, seluruh jalur OTA diaudit ulang.

## 📌 Kontrak versi

**ANTI-DOWNGRADE: OFF**

Versi firmware yang **valid dan berbeda** dari versi perangkat boleh di-update.

Contoh:

- V5.7 → V5.8 ✅
- V5.7 → V5.6 ✅
- V5.7 → V6.0 ✅
- V5.7 → V5.7 ❌ tidak perlu update

Jadi segel ini **tidak** mengubah kebijakan versi OTA.

## 🔒 Kondisi baseline

OTA V5.7 berhasil digunakan untuk memperbarui hardware pada tahap historis sebelumnya.
Active source saat ini adalah V6.2 dan tetap source-only: belum dikompilasi, dibuat BIN, diflash, atau divalidasi pada hardware:

`firmware/JEXFYZ-V6.2.ino`

Keberhasilan OTA V5.7 adalah bukti historis untuk V5.7 saja, bukan bukti bahwa OTA V6.2 telah lulus hardware validation.

Dokumen ini **bukan** cryptographic signature, bukan CI enforcement, dan bukan pengganti pengujian OTA pada hardware.

### Prinsip utama

> **OTA sudah bekerja — jangan disentuh kecuali ada alasan OTA yang nyata.**

## HISTORICAL — V6.2 Online OTA TLS/CA clock validation (superseded by V6.3) — 2026-10-13

- [HISTORICAL / SUPERSEDED] V6.2 Online OTA synchronized system time before CA-validated HTTPS. This is no longer the active V6.3 connection path.
- Redirects were disabled for the direct raw GitHub BIN endpoint; CA validation and the NTP gate were subsequently removed by the V6.3 legacy-path restoration.
- Repository allowlist remains limited to `TenzoNkz/JEXFYZ-Firmware`; no custom firmware SHA/signature is added; Local OTA remains unchanged.
- The unapproved temporary quality workflow was removed after it failed to push a generated lockfile; test/analyze steps were skipped and no lockfile was committed.
