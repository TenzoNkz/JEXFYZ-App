# 00_WORK_STATUS — JE X FYZ / JE Cooler

> **This is the first file-level work marker in the repository root.** The value below describes the latest recorded chat work session, not the overall completion of the product.

## Current marker

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **STATUS** | **WAITING_OWNER** |
| Mode | Eksekusi Full |
| Work item | Repo-wide hygiene audit and native Floating Monitor Fan icon correction + regression test |
| Updated | 2026-11-13 (Asia/Jakarta) |
| Last completed milestone | Fixed duplicate native F icon branch, added unique icon-map regression, audited 52 Markdown docs and 12 skill mirrors, and updated canonical project memory |
| Result | Build #159 remains latest verified package. Owner reports V7.2 + Build #159 installed and safe (USER-REPORTED). Native F icon source/test repair is committed but not built. |
| Latest App source/package commit | `aff8b8ec2796d03432f4f8b000f6e70205eccf48` (test commit; native source fix is `e0b68c3e98a5d75fe40c71bc0a7647712615c33d`) |
| Last verified package | Build #159 — source `cdca38b9e4f2f99006db8feae40c07c6f9bdfb0a`; Release `403010611`, tag `jexfyz-latest` |
| Validation | Build #159 hosted CI passed on its immutable source. Native patch/source read-back and static test-contract inspection passed; current test inventory 188. New Flutter test, analyzer and Kotlin/Gradle compile are NOT RUN. |
| Blocker | Local Dart/Flutter/Gradle/ADB are absent. Patch needs a separate owner-authorized guarded App Build to validate and package. No App Build, Firmware/BIN, Firebase, OTA or device operation is authorized here. |
| Next action | Owner separately issues Eksekusi Build App! to validate current main; inspect duplicate-branch warning is gone and all gates pass. Do not trigger or publish from this Eksekusi Full session. |

## Status meanings

- **IN_PROGRESS** — a substantive Diskusi, Eksekusi Full or Build App task has started and its requested scope has not been closed.
- **COMPLETED** — the selected mode's scope is finished, its durable checkpoint is saved and the final repository state has been re-read. This does not mean the entire JE Cooler project or a later release is complete.
- **BLOCKED** — work is unfinished because a concrete tool, runner, validation result, service or other dependency prevents progress. Record the blocker and exact next action.
- **WAITING_OWNER** — work is unfinished and requires an owner decision, input or a new authorization.
- **RECOVERY_REQUIRED** — a `Chat Stuck!` recovery has found an unfinished prior session. Continue only within that session's last valid authorization.

## Update protocol

1. **At the start of every substantive work session**, set this marker to `IN_PROGRESS`, record the selected mode, task, start date and last verified checkpoint. Do this before substantive edits or side effects.
2. **At every meaningful milestone**, refresh the last completed milestone, current step, evidence and last known commit/checkpoint. Keep the status `IN_PROGRESS` until the requested scope is closed.
3. **At the end of the session**, set `COMPLETED` only after the work for that mode is complete, required available checks have been run, canonical notes/checkpoint are saved, and GitHub read-back verifies the final state. Otherwise use `BLOCKED` or `WAITING_OWNER`.
4. **During `Chat Stuck!` recovery**, read this file first. If it says `IN_PROGRESS`, mark the prior work `RECOVERY_REQUIRED`, read `CHAT_TRANSFER.md`, verify live main/Actions and resume only a recoverable, already-authorized scope. Once recovery is underway, update the marker to `IN_PROGRESS` with the recovered scope.
5. Keep this file as a **single current snapshot**, not an append-only log. Detailed engineering state belongs in `CHAT_TRANSFER.md`; release attempts and artifact evidence belong in `APP_BUILD_REPORT.md`; historical decisions belong in the relevant subject notes and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Important limitation: not a live process monitor

GitHub cannot tell whether a ChatGPT conversation is still generating, has frozen, or was closed unexpectedly. There is no automatic heartbeat from the chat to this repository.

- If a chat is interrupted between updates, this marker remains at its last committed value—usually `IN_PROGRESS`. That is a durable indication that the session was not formally closed, **not proof that a background process is still running**.
- The `Updated` date and last completed milestone show how fresh the information is. A new `Chat Stuck!` session must inspect this marker, `CHAT_TRANSFER.md`, live GitHub state and any actual Actions run before deciding what can safely resume.
- A status becomes `COMPLETED` only when the closing update has been committed and verified. The marker remains useful even when the final chat response is never delivered.
