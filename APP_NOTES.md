# JE X FYZ / JE Cooler — App Reference

This file is the durable App behavior/design contract. Live source and the current workflow remain authoritative.

## Latest verified release and current source — 2026-10-17

- Build #70 (run 38998407325, released source commit eb1224232241ca5d44d43e25919fd228875029ab) passed all 21 active workflow steps. Dart analysis completed with 23 info-level deprecations; 86/86 Flutter tests passed; Android production compile/gate, APK obfuscation, V1/V2/V3 signing/certificate, corresponding source ZIP and re-downloaded Release asset checks passed.
- Native JUnit compile/test tasks were NO-SOURCE after FPS-only native tests were removed; do not count any native JUnit test cases as executed in Build #70. Full log and artifact digests are in APP_BUILD_REPORT.md.
- Build #70 retires FPS and Shizuku. Floating Monitor supports B/H/V/A/P/F with F=Fan Speed. Schema v2 discards legacy schema-v1 F (FPS) and maps S (Speed) to F. The released APK/source ZIP target commit eb1224232241ca5d44d43e25919fd228875029ab.
- Build #70 remains the exact verified release source. Main now has post-release indicator-motion and manual-voltage-toggle source changes that are NOT INCLUDED in Build #70. Physical phone rendering and BLE/Fan Speed behavior remain NOT DEVICE-VERIFIED.

## Identity and package

- User-facing app name: **JE Cooler**; branding/header: **JE X FYZ**.
- Flutter/Dart Android app; BLE implemented with `flutter_blue_plus`.
- Package: `com.horizontalzzz.jexfyz`; pubspec version observed at last reconciliation: `1.0.0+3`.
- Android `versionName "Telegram @horizontalzzz"` is intentional creator/contact identity. Preserve exactly.
- Transparent 1:1 visual assets: `assets/jexfyzicon.png`, `assets/jexfyzcooler.png`; Android icon also exists at `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/jexfyzicon.png`.

## Visual layout and navigation

- Design direction based on Horizon Cooler App: dark header with white rounded content panel, compact cards and tab layout.
- Principal mode tabs: VOLTAGE and ADAPTIVE.
- Main/home information: Hotside Temperature, Battery Temperature, voltage indicator, Adaptive mode, Peltier and Fan state, Fan speed and safety/Notify reason.
- Menu hierarchy expected by the project: VOLTAGE → CONTROL → ADAPTIVE → LED → TEMPERATURE. Keep submenus compact and sideways where specified.
- Cooler image belongs on the right in the established compact layout. Do not casually redesign the approved visual identity.
- Use `DESIGN_NOTES.md` for the approved grille/icon/design constraints.

## Home indicators: colors and animations

- Disconnected telemetry must render as unknown (--) without switching the icon/text to black or generic grey. Retain each metric's lowest semantic accent as a visual fallback; this is not a claim that the device output is ON or OFF.
- Battery temperature: Ice Blue at or below 30°C, a smooth cyan/amber/orange transition from 30–40°C, and Burning Red at or above 40°C. Battery thermal fill uses the same 30–40°C band; the ≥40°C warning threshold remains exact.
- Hotside temperature: Ice Blue at or below 30°C, smooth transition above 30°C, and Burning Red at the configured Hotside Limit. The visual palette/fill must track the current limit; it must never alter or replace Firmware-owned safety behavior.
- Manual Voltage labels retain their semantic accent: 5V red, 9V green, 12V blue; unknown/disconnected voltage uses the 5V/lowest-voltage red fallback. The 5V/9V/12V rows stay neutral and the active toggle alone uses the theme primary color, without an extra check glyph. The shared switch helper and other control toggles keep their existing styling.
- Home status icons use compact, bounded Canvas shapes with a shared eased activity transition. OFF transitions keep the motion running through the 440 ms fade-out before pausing; ON transitions resume from the retained phase and travel to the next equivalent full-cycle boundary instead of jumping to phase zero. Repeating effects must meet at the same pose at both ends of the cycle; thermal flame flicker uses integer harmonics. Battery segments use a subtle staggered ripple. Peltier keeps a stable six-branched free-standing crystal while four bounded frost sparks orbit smoothly; motion remains decorative, not a claim about actual ice/cooling. Fan rotation keeps its voltage-dependent phase-continuous cycle and dedicated OFF coast-down.

## Floating Monitor presentation contract

- Exactly six metrics are supported in the current source: **B/H/V/A/P/F** — Battery Temperature, Hotside Temperature, Voltage, Adaptive, Peltier, and Fan Speed. The floating label F means Fan Speed; FPS is retired.
- Persisted metric schema version 2 migrates older schema-v1 configurations: old F (FPS) selections are discarded and old S (Speed) selections migrate to F. Config is normalized before it is sent to the native overlay so an old seven-metric order cannot reintroduce a retired metric.
- The display is Letters-only; legacy saved Icons configuration migrates to Letters and the style selector remains removed.
- Size slider is 0.30×–1.00× in 0.05× steps (14 intervals), default 0.60×. Persisted values snap into that range. Native pinch scaling and runtime geometry accept the same upper bound.
- Background opacity is 0–100% in 5% increments; the displayed number remains visible, but the 50% midpoint label is removed. Legacy values snap to the nearest 5%. Opacity affects the background only, not metric text.
- Horizontal metrics remain centered as one group. Vertical letter rows share a single left edge. The floating window remains freely draggable; WindowManager gravity stays TOP | START and saved position is unchanged.
- Floating Monitor has no Shizuku permission card or privileged FPS sampler. Fan Speed shows its live speed while Fan is on, localized OFF/MATI while Fan is off, and unknown (--) while disconnected.

## Controls and voltage

- Manual voltage levels: 5 V, 9 V, 12 V. Expected user touch cycle is 5→9→12→9→5, with the established ~1-second manual-switch guard.
- Voltage indicator LED default mapping: 5 V red, 9 V green, 12 V blue. Users can customize colors and reset to defaults.
- PWM Fan speed control belongs in the CONTROL submenu; increments should be practical (multiples of 5 or 10).
- PWM Fan speed adjustment applies only to Manual Volt at 12 V, not Adaptive mode. Adaptive controls its own Fan behavior.
- Adaptive ON locks the manual voltage touch sensor. Toggling Adaptive ON/OFF returns hardware to safe 5 V first. When leaving Adaptive, restore a previously running Peltier only through the safety gates and its normal 5-second OFF→ON soft-start.
- The App must not claim rail transition complete until matching authoritative `VOLTAGE` telemetry confirms it.

## Firmware telemetry is authoritative

- App state must reflect physical Firmware telemetry, not only command ACKs or optimistic local writes.
- A Touch Adaptive-OFF gesture must publish the authoritative Adaptive/ceiling/Fan/Peltier/Fan-speed telemetry so Dashboard and Floating Monitor cannot remain stale.
- Home/dashboard telemetry and Floating Monitor show unknown output state (`--`) while BLE is offline; they must not display stale physical state. CONTROL, ADAPTIVE, and LED menu switch rows instead use a disabled visual OFF fallback with the toggle knob at the left. This is presentation only, not confirmation that hardware outputs are OFF; controls remain disabled until BLE/P1 session sync and authoritative state are received.
- Safety/Notify error state may be cleared only after healthy live safety telemetry, not from an unrelated success ACK.
- Safety messages must be clear and localized; never expose raw protocol stage tokens or underscore-formatted internal reason strings to normal UI.
- Hotside safety re-arm copy uses the current firmware rule: Hotside at or below `hotLimit - 1°C` continuously for five seconds.

## BLE / session contract

- BLE service UUID: `6f1c0001-7f35-4d0f-9b9a-7e9b2f5c1001`.
- RX UUID: `6f1c0002-7f35-4d0f-9b9a-7e9b2f5c1001`.
- TX UUID: `6f1c0003-7f35-4d0f-9b9a-7e9b2f5c1001`.
- Protocol identifier is P1; require P1 readiness during session sync.
- Auto Connect/reconnect must respect the saved preference, a previously known/pair-associated cooler identity, Android Bluetooth/permission/location prerequisites, and BLE sync state. Cancel retries/scanning when prerequisites are unavailable and suppress scans while syncing.
- Do not mutate UI physical state based only on Touch or control ACK. Consume authoritative state deltas.
- Secure BLE command writes use encryption and bonding. Reconnect/first pairing still needs physical Android validation; Just Works does not provide MITM identity assurance without an input/display path.

## Android notifications and icons

- Android notification small icons use the vector `R.drawable.ic_notification`: a bold white `JE` letterform on a transparent background, optimized as an alpha silhouette for Android's monochrome small-icon mask. `JexNotificationUtils.kt` sets this as the sole small icon and does not set a large icon. The full-color app icon and dashboard branding are unchanged.
- User notifications use `JE X FYZ` as the content title and the localized event/status as the body; connected/disconnected notifications must not reverse these fields. Tapping opens JE Cooler.
- The BLE foreground-service notification has a meaningful localized connected-session body rather than an empty string. Floating Monitor uses the same branded icon and a non-empty service description.
- When Android 13+ notification permission is absent, the first real notification attempt requests permission instead of silently dropping every alert. The actual display remains subject to user choice and Android/OEM behavior.

## Online OTA App state

- OTA protocol order in the established path: `OTAENTER`, `SSID`, `PASS`, `URL`, `VERSION`, `CLOUDOTA`.
- Arm expected OTA disconnect/recovery before sending `CLOUDOTA`; OTA disconnect is a lifecycle event, not a generic Bluetooth failure.
- Missing `CLOUDOTA` ACK due to TIMEOUT/DISCONNECTED is ambiguous, not proof of rejection. Preserve OTA recovery state and wait for reconnect/OTA result. Roll back only on a definite rejection while BLE remains connected.
- After OTA reconnect, require normal P1/session sync and surface the one-shot OTA result.
- Current production metadata is expected to provide version + link; do not add a hash/signature requirement without explicit user approval.
- Before any App OTA change, read `OTA_PROTECTION.md` and `OTA_REGRESSION_MEMORY.md`.

## Localization and persistent settings

- All user-facing safety, Notify, command, BLE connection and OTA messages use the localization layer.
- LED color parsing normalizes optional `#` and letter case before confirmation.

## LED mode and preview synchronization

- Six App modes use stable firmware IDs: 01 Static (1), 02 Breath (2), 03 Comet (4), 04 Dual Chase (5), 05 Left ↔ Right (6), 06 Rainbow (7). ID 3 / Mirror Pulse is retired and never reused.
- Firmware V6.6 emits one `LED_SYNC:<mode>,<phase_ms>,<cycle_ms>` tuple, computed immediately before BLE notify. Mode, phase and cycle arrive atomically, and the phase does not age while waiting in the queue.
- The App interpolates the phase from a monotonic local clock and adjusts drift at later snapshots; a phase update must not restart the animation controller. Separate `LED_PHASE` and `LED_CYCLE_MS` handling remains a compatibility fallback for older V6.x firmware.
- Preview pixel order follows the physical strip: right top→bottom indices 0–3, left bottom→top indices 4–7. The compact layout is left arrow, four left LEDs, centered localized mode name only (no numeric index), four right LEDs, right arrow.
- LED-column backgrounds are slightly darker for contrast. Preview pixel visibility/glow is independent of the hardware Brightness slider, so colors stay vivid even at low hardware brightness; animation levels still distinguish the active mode. This does not change brightness commands or physical Firmware rendering.
- The separate Color Picker offers 36 curated hue-ordered presets without HEX labels, remains bottom-pinned in the safe area, and uses localized top-left Cancel and top-right Select actions. Swatch taps update only a local draft (checkmark, preview swatch and localized name); they do not send BLE COLOR or dismiss the panel. Select sends the draft through the existing confirmed COLOR command and closes only after success; a definite failure or missing confirmation leaves the dialog open and preserves the last applied RGB state. Cancel discards the draft and closes without sending RGB. Taps outside the panel and system Back are blocked, so the action buttons control dismissal. The outer panel is not draggable or wrapped in a vertical scroll view. Text/swatch sizing is enlarged for comfortable viewing while preserving the six-column palette. Names are localized and legacy aliases (including Cyan #00FFFF) remain; Brightness stays the single intensity control.
- Firmware migrates saved mode ID 3/invalid values to Static and rejects new MODE:3 commands. On older firmware that still reports ID 3, the App labels the mode Unsupported rather than rendering Mirror Pulse; the user can select a supported mode.
- Firmware safety/OTA indicators continue to override decorative RGB effects.
- Do not change settings storage or defaults without a scoped task and regression review.
- Firmware persistent preferences use a 10-second quiet period; Adaptive Profile itself is runtime-only. See `FIRMWARE_NOTES.md`.

## Floating Monitor implementation and current source state

- FloatingMonitorService owns the overlay window; Flutter remains the single BLE/GATT client and streams authoritative telemetry. After native service attachment, Flutter replays the current telemetry snapshot. Native layout/redraw tracks changing live-value width.
- The overlay remains freely draggable with WindowManager gravity TOP | START and persisted coordinates. Horizontal metrics center as one group; vertical letter rows all share the same left edge. Size is 0.30×–1.00× in 0.05× steps (default 0.60×). Background opacity is 0–100% in 5% steps with live percent and endpoint marks only; Black/White background and text contrast remain.
- Current metrics are B/H/V/A/P/F. F is Fan Speed. When BLE telemetry is disconnected, live device values are unknown (--) and no stale output state is inferred.
- FPS, SurfaceFlinger TimeStats sampling, Shizuku permission UI/provider/UserService/AIDL, related parser/watchdog tests and Shizuku-only license files are removed from active App source. The release workflow audit and source archive packaging no longer depend on them.
- Schema version 2 maps old schema-v1 S (Speed) to F (Fan Speed) and drops old schema-v1 F (FPS). Flutter contract tests cover migration and removal of FPS/Shizuku UI.
- Build #70 is the latest verified release and includes FPS/Shizuku retirement. CI verified the source/test/build/signing/source archive and release assets; phone overlay visuals and live BLE telemetry remain unverified.

## Phone battery telemetry and Battery Protection UI boundary

- The App reads Android battery temperature through the native `je_x_fyz/battery_temp` MethodChannel (`getBatteryTemperature`) and sends `PHONE:BT=<Celsius>` every 1 second while a BLE session is ready. Invalid/unavailable readings send the invalid sentinel rather than a stale temperature.
- The heartbeat queue coalesces pending battery messages so slow BLE transmission does not produce an unbounded backlog. Firmware considers phone Battery data valid only for its 5-second `BATTERY_VALID_TTL_MS`; when it expires, HOTSIDE_BATTERY behavior falls back to HOTSIDE control without silently changing the runtime-selected profile.
- Current Battery-zone setting defaults: 5 V threshold 25°C and 12 V threshold 35°C; current firmware has a 0.5°C zone hysteresis. Live source remains authoritative if these values change.
- **Permanent UI requirement:** do not display a standalone “Battery Protection Guard” badge/guard/status indicator in the App. This is a presentation rule, not permission to weaken thermal protection or suppress an independently actionable, localized safety/Notify message.
- **Pairing design requirement / implementation status not established:** the project intent is one authorized App identity/one key-lock pairing relationship per cooler firmware. Current source-level checks confirm encrypted/bonded BLE writes, but do not establish an exclusive one-App-only provisioning/lock mechanism end-to-end. Do not claim the exclusive pairing lock is implemented until its concrete source flow and physical pairing behavior are verified.

## Current App QC boundary

- Latest verified release: Build #70 / run 38998407325, released source commit eb1224232241ca5d44d43e25919fd228875029ab.
- 86/86 Flutter tests passed. Dart analysis and all 21 active release workflow steps passed, including Android production compile/gate, obfuscated APK, V1/V2/V3 certificate checks, matching source ZIP and re-downloaded Release asset verification. Native JUnit tasks were NO-SOURCE after FPS-specific native test files were removed.
- APK asset 649412242, 54,538,331 bytes, SHA-256 229aaae5745456498d35f356ee6e0cdde81e7bb29f37238b1172f99f992ab404. Matching source ZIP asset 649412243, 2,847,010 bytes, SHA-256 d0a79cdaf99b169b68cda04c5c3162062f493f0cb6f6ec02c1531950e4bbd8ae. Certificate/warning/step detail remains in APP_BUILD_REPORT.md.
- Physical overlay layout, live BLE telemetry/Fan Speed value, phone animation and actual BLE/Firmware/thermal/OTA behavior remain UNVERIFIED. Build #70 was App-only.

## Dashboard indicator motion

- Dashboard status indicators use bounded Canvas shapes and a separate eased activity controller. OFF transitions keep a running phase moving through a 440 ms fade-out, then pause. ON transitions continue from the retained phase to the next equivalent full-cycle boundary, avoiding a jump back to frame zero. Fan retains its separate voltage-dependent boundary retarget and OFF coast-down.
- Battery indicator remains segmented, but its visual thermal band now runs from Ice Blue at ≤30°C to Burning Red at ≥40°C. Hotside transitions from Ice Blue at ≤30°C to Burning Red at the configured Hotside Limit; neither palette changes safety decisions.
- Thermal flame flicker uses integer harmonics so its geometry matches at the loop seam; Battery segment highlights ripple gently across the three bars. Voltage bolt sheen moves back and forth continuously and stays clipped to the bolt. Bluetooth ripples fade smoothly at the loop boundary; Adaptive remains a compact orbital ring/core. Peltier uses a stable six-branch crystal with four bounded orbiting sparks and activity-faded motion, with no module box. Fan uses compact blades; its 5V/9V/12V rotation periods and dedicated phase-continuous voltage transition/coast behavior remain. Fan Speed retargets the gauge smoothly.
- These are App-side visual changes. They do not change Firmware source, BLE command protocol, thermal safety or physical LED rendering. Animations/visual bounds are source-edited but have not been exercised on a physical phone.
