# JE X FYZ / JE Cooler — App Reference

This file is the durable App behavior/design contract. Live `lib/` source and the current workflow remain authoritative for implementation.

## Identity and package

- User-facing app name: **JE Cooler**; branding/header: **JE X FYZ**.
- Flutter/Dart Android app; BLE implemented with `flutter_blue_plus`.
- Package: `com.horizontalzzz.jexfyz`; pubspec version observed at last reconciliation: `1.0.0+3`.
- Android `versionName "Telegram @horizontalzzz"` is intentional creator/contact identity. Preserve exactly.
- Transparent 1:1 visual assets: `assets/jexfyzicon.png`, `assets/jexfyzcooler.png`; Android icon also exists at `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/jexfyzicon.png`.

## Visual layout and navigation

- Design direction based on Horizon Cooler App: dark header with white rounded content panel, compact cards and tab layout.
- Principal mode tabs: VOLTAGE and ADAPTIVE.
- Main/home information: Hotside Temperature, Battery Temperature, voltage indicator, Adaptive mode, Peltier and Fan state, Fan speed and safety/Notify reason.
- Menu hierarchy expected by the project: VOLTAGE → CONTROL → ADAPTIVE → LED → TEMPERATURE. Keep submenus compact and sideways where specified.
- Cooler image belongs on the right in the established compact layout. Do not casually redesign the approved visual identity.
- Use `DESIGN_NOTES.md` for the approved grille/icon/design constraints.

## Controls and voltage

- Manual voltage levels: 5 V, 9 V, 12 V. Expected user touch cycle is 5→9→12→9→5, with the established ~1-second manual-switch guard.
- Voltage indicator LED default mapping: 5 V red, 9 V green, 12 V blue. Users can customize colors and reset to defaults.
- PWM Fan speed control belongs in the CONTROL submenu; increments should be practical (multiples of 5 or 10).
- PWM Fan speed adjustment applies only to Manual Volt at 12 V, not Adaptive mode. Adaptive controls its own Fan behavior.
- Adaptive ON locks the manual voltage touch sensor. Toggling Adaptive ON/OFF returns hardware to safe 5 V first. When leaving Adaptive, restore a previously running Peltier only through the safety gates and its normal 5-second OFF→ON soft-start.
- The App must not claim rail transition complete until matching authoritative `VOLTAGE` telemetry confirms it.

## Firmware telemetry is authoritative

- App state must reflect physical Firmware telemetry, not only command ACKs or optimistic local writes.
- A Touch Adaptive-OFF gesture must publish the authoritative Adaptive/ceiling/Fan/Peltier/Fan-speed telemetry so Dashboard and Floating Monitor cannot remain stale.
- While BLE is offline or session state is unknown, show unknown output state (`--`) rather than stale on/off values.
- Safety/Notify error state may be cleared only after healthy live safety telemetry, not from an unrelated success ACK.
- Safety messages must be clear and localized; never expose raw protocol stage tokens or underscore-formatted internal reason strings to normal UI.
- Hotside safety re-arm copy uses the current firmware rule: Hotside at or below `hotLimit - 1°C` continuously for five seconds.

## BLE / session contract

- BLE service UUID: `6f1c0001-7f35-4d0f-9b9a-7e9b2f5c1001`.
- RX UUID: `6f1c0002-7f35-4d0f-9b9a-7e9b2f5c1001`.
- TX UUID: `6f1c0003-7f35-4d0f-9b9a-7e9b2f5c1001`.
- Protocol identifier is P1; require P1 readiness during session sync.
- Auto Connect/reconnect must respect the saved preference, a previously known/pair-associated cooler identity, Android Bluetooth/permission/location prerequisites, and BLE sync state. Cancel retries/scanning when prerequisites are unavailable and suppress scans while syncing.
- Do not mutate UI physical state based only on Touch or control ACK. Consume authoritative state deltas.
- Secure BLE command writes use encryption and bonding. Reconnect/first pairing still needs physical Android validation; Just Works does not provide MITM identity assurance without an input/display path.

## Online OTA App state

- OTA protocol order in the established path: `OTAENTER`, `SSID`, `PASS`, `URL`, `VERSION`, `CLOUDOTA`.
- Arm expected OTA disconnect/recovery before sending `CLOUDOTA`; OTA disconnect is a lifecycle event, not a generic Bluetooth failure.
- Missing `CLOUDOTA` ACK due to TIMEOUT/DISCONNECTED is ambiguous, not proof of rejection. Preserve OTA recovery state and wait for reconnect/OTA result. Roll back only on a definite rejection while BLE remains connected.
- After OTA reconnect, require normal P1/session sync and surface the one-shot OTA result.
- Current production metadata is expected to provide version + link; do not add a hash/signature requirement without explicit user approval.
- Before any App OTA change, read `OTA_PROTECTION.md` and `OTA_REGRESSION_MEMORY.md`.

## Localization and persistent settings

- All user-facing safety, Notify, command, BLE connection and OTA messages use the localization layer.
- LED color parsing normalizes optional `#` and letter case before confirmation.
- Do not change settings storage or defaults without a scoped task and regression review.
- Firmware persistent preferences use a 10-second quiet period; Adaptive Profile itself is runtime-only. See `FIRMWARE_NOTES.md`.

## Current App QC boundary

At the last reconciliation, source changes and static contract tests existed for BLE rediscovery cancellation, ambiguous OTA ACK, touch Adaptive-OFF telemetry, and voltage-transition telemetry handling. The latest test/analyze status must be checked live; these docs do not claim tests ran. App Build is separately authorized and does not validate Firmware compile, BIN, OTA, or physical cooling behavior.
